# Group 2 Final Project


## Current Project Segment - One

### Date Updated - Nov 4, 2021

### Next Meeting - Sat Nov 6 at 10am (TA office hours)


## Group Members
Mohammad Ali Sakhi, Patrick Moores, Ramon Sa, Somto Esomeju, Bo Wang, (Mark Fulton - TA)


## Communication Protocols
- meet twice per week during class time
- group communication over Slack



## Roles - Week 1
Square - responsible for the repository - will also manage project readme
Responsible: Patrick

Triangle - create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.  
Responsible: Mohammed, Bo

Circle - create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure that the database works seamlessly with the rest of the project.  
Responsible: Ramon, Somto
    
Cross - decide which technologies to use for each step of the project.  
Responsible: Group discussion    



## Topic
Build a machine learning model to provide classification status to cities/regions are at higher risk, may need booster vaccines to control spread and outbreaks.
Rationale for Topic Selection: Need for boosters has become a public policy topic. COVID vaccinations are expected to become an annual need. Provide cities with appropriate planning tools to deal with outbreaks or increases in infection rates.

## Machine Learning Model
- present a provisional machine learning model that:
- takes in data from the provisional database
- output(s) labels for the input data (i.e. print columns and datatypes)


## Database
- present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes:
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database


## Dashboard
- what do we want to show in the dashboard? - what reports will we use? (3 to 4 reports)
- what questions are the reports answering?


## Technologies
- Data preparation (Pandas/SQL)
- Machine learning (Scilearn/Tensorflow)
- Visualization Dashboard (Tableau)


## GitHub Deliverables - Segment One
- project repo created and each team member has at least one branch 


## Files for Segment One
- Readme.md (project sketch)
