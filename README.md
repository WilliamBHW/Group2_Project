# Group 2 Final Project


## Current Project Segment - Two

### Date Updated - Nov 16, 2021

### Next Meeting - class on Tuesday, November 9


## Group Members
Mohammad Ali Sakhi, Patrick Moores, Ramon Sa, Somto Esomeju, Bo Wang, Mark Fulton (TA)


## Communication Protocols
- meet three times per week (Tuesday class, Thursday class, Saturday office hours)
- group communication over Slack


## Roles - Segment 2
**Square** - responsible for the repository - will also manage project readme    
**Responsible:** Patrick

**Triangle** - create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.  
**Responsible:** Mohammed, Bo

**Circle** - create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure that the database works seamlessly with the rest of the project.  
**Responsible:** Ramon, Somto
    
**Cross** - decide which technologies to use for each step of the project.  
**Responsible:** Group discussion    


## Topic
**Purpose:** To build a machine learning model to provide classification status to cities/regions that are at higher risk of having a COVID outbreak.

**Rationale for Topic Selection:** The need for COVID-19 booster vaccines has recently become a public health and public policy issue. Also, COVID vaccinations are expected to become an annual need. The output information from our model will provide cities with data to deal with outbreaks or increases in infection rates.
