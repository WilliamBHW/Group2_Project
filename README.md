# Group 2 Final Project


## Current Project Segment - One


## Group Members
Mohammad Ali Sakhi, Patrick Moores, Ramon Sa, Somto Esomeju, William Wang, (Mark Fulton - TA)


## Communication Protocols
- meet twice per week during class time
- group communication over Slack


## Roles - Week 1
Square - responsible for the repository
Responsible: 
Triangle - create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps
Responsible: 
Circle - create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure that the database works seamlessly with the rest of the project
Responsible: 
Cross - decide which technologies to use for each step of the project
Responsible: Group discussion



## Topic
Build a machine learning model to provide classification status to cities/regions are at higher risk, may need booster vaccines to control spread and outbreaks.
Rationale for Topic Selection: Need for boosters has become a public policy topic. COVID vaccinations are expected to become an annual need. Provide cities with appropriate planning tools to deal with outbreaks or increases in infection rates.


## Data Source
- Description of source data
- Questions to be answered with data: rate of vaccination (one dose, two doses, 2 does + booster), rates of infection

## Machine Learning Model
- present a provisional machine learning model that:
- takes in data from the provisional database
- output(s) labels for the input data (i.e. print columns and datatypes)


## Database
- present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes:
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database


## Technologies
- Data preparation (Pandas/SQL)
- Machine learning (Scilearn/Tensorflow)
- Visualization Dashboard (Tableau)


## GitHub Deliverables - Segment One
- One branch per team member (complete - screenshot?)
- Each team member has at least 4 commits for project segment 1 (I'm not sure how this happens in the first segment - PM)


## Files for Segment One
- Readme.md (project sketch)
