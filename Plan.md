1. Load target datasets
2. Merge datasets 
3. ETL (if needed)
4. Take out target variables
5. Split datasets into train and test model (if needed)
6. Consider PCA variables
7. Perform K-Mean clustering (with elbow curve)
8. Perform Hierarchical clustering (with dendrogram)
9. Decide number of clusters based on both algorithm
10. Perform Unsupervised ML to cluster dataset
